# Multiplayer-Snake-very-terrible-
Implementation client-server game "Snake" with SFML library (SFML Graphics.hpp &amp; Network.hpp)

This is project so terrible for two reasons (it seems these reasons may more):
1 - No collision detection
2 - One snake for all clients -_-


In the project, you need to install SFML (SFML\Network.cpp install separately)
